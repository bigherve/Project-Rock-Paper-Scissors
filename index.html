        /* Use prompt() to get input from the user.
                    write a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. 
                    We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play.
                    Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - 
                    and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock". Make your function case insensitive.

                    return the results of this function call, not console.log() them. 
                    console.log the results: Write a NEW function called game(). 
                    Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.

                    use loops to do this.  
                    At this point you should be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.
