        /* write a function called computerPlay that will randomly  either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’.
        We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play.
        write a function called computerPlay that will randomly  either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. 
        Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - 
        and then  a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock". Make your function case insensitive.

        console.log the results: Write a NEW function called game(). 
         the results of this function call, not console.log() them. 
        Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.

        At this point you should be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.
        use loops to do this.
        Use prompt() to get input from the user.*/
