        /*The game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. 
            We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play.
            Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - 
            and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

            Make your function case insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation)

            Important note: you want to return the results of this function call, not console.log() them. 
            To test this function console.log the results: Write a NEW function called game(). 
            Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.

            if you already know about loops from somewhere else feel free to use them. 
            At this point you should be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.
            Use prompt() to get input from the user. Read the docs here if you need to.
            Feel free to re-work your previous functions if you need to. Specifically, you might want to change the return value to something more useful.
            Feel free to create more “helper” functions if you think it would be useful.
